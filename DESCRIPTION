Description: Glandular trichomes are metabolic cell factories 
        with the capacity to produce large quantities of secondary metabolites. 
        Little is known about the connection between central carbon metabolism 
        and metabolic productivity for secondary metabolites in glandular trichomes. 
        To address this gap in our knowledge, we performed comparative metabolomics, 
        transcriptomics, proteomics and 13C-labeling of type VI glandular trichomes 
        and leaves from a cultivated (Solanum lycopersicum LA4024) 
        and a wild (Solanum habrochaites LA1777) tomato accession. Specific features 
        of glandular trichomes that drive the formation of secondary metabolites 
        could be identified. Tomato type VI trichomes are photosynthetic but acquire 
        their carbon essentially from leaf sucrose. The energy and reducing power 
        from photosynthesis are used to support the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,
        while the comparatively reduced Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle activity 
        may be involved in recycling metabolic CO2. Glandular trichomes cope 
        with oxidative stress by producing high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
        oxylipins, and glutathione. Finally, distinct mechanisms are present 
        in glandular trichomes to increase the supply of precursors 
        for the isoprenoid pathways. Particularly, the citrate-malate shuttle 
        supplies cytosolic acetyl CoA and plastidic glycolysis and malic enzyme support 
        the formation of plastidic pyruvate. A model is proposed on how glandular trichomes 
        achieve high metabolic productivity.
